[['One Little Christmas Tree','Stevie Wonder','One little Christmas tree was standing alone
Waiting for someone to come by
One little Christmas tree that never had grown
Cried as he looked up to the sky
Oh please, Mr. Father Tree, the tallest of all
I'm so afraid and so alone
Could one little Christmas tree so tiny and small
Light up someone's home, 'cause
One little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little child can find a toy
One little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little heart can find some joy
One little angel who was riding a star
Cried as she looked down at the tree
Oh please, Mr. Father Tree, wherever you are
May I give him the star you gave to me
Then in the heavens came a voice from afar
A voice that was heard throughout the world
Go down little angel girl, and give him your star
Tonight he'll light the world, 'cause
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So those who are lost may find their way
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So all men may see you on Christmas Day
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So those who are lost may find their way
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So all men may see you on Christmas Day
One little Christmas tree can light up the world'],['Who Would Imagine A King?','Whitney Houston','Mommies and Daddies, always believe
...
That their little angels are special indeed
...
And you could grow up to be anything
...
But who would imagine a king
...
A sheperd or teacher, is what you could be
...
Or maybe a fisherman out on the sea
...
Or maybe a carpenter, building things
...
But who would imagine a king
...
It was so clear, when the wisemen arrived
...
And the angels were singing your name
...
That the world would be different
...
Cause you were alive
That's why heaven stood still to proclaim
...
One day an angel, said quietly
...
That soon he would bring something special to me
...
And of all of the wonderful gifts he could bring
...
Who would imagine, who could imagine, who would imagine a king
...
Ooooooooooooo

Cold and weary with a babe inside
And I wonder what I've done
Holy father you have come
And chosen me now to carry your son
I am waiting in a silent prayer
I am frightened by the load I bear
In a world as cold as stone
Must I walk this path alone?
Be with me now
Be with me now
Breath of heaven
Hold me together
Be forever near me
Breath of heaven
Breath of heaven
Lighten my darkness
Pour over me your holiness
For you are holy
Breath of heaven
Do you wonder as you watch my face
If a wiser one should have had my place
But I offer all I am
For the mercy of your plan
Help me be strong
Help me be
Help me
Breath of heaven
Hold me together
Be forever near me
Breath of heaven
Breath of heaven
Lighten my darkness
Pour over me your holiness
For you are holy

And gay happy meetings when friends come to call

Why can't I find you?
Why have you gone away?
Where is the laughter
You used to bring me?
Why can't I hear music play?
My world is changing
I'm rearranging
Does that mean Christmas changes too?
Where are you Christmas?
Do you remember
The one you used to know?
I'm not the same one
See what the time has done
Is that why you have let me go?
Christmas is here, everywhere
Oh, oh
Christmas is here, if you care
Oh
If there is love in your heart and your mind
You will feel like Christmas all the time
Oh
I feel you Christmas
I know I found you
You never fade away
Oh
The joy of Christmas
Stays here inside us
Fills each and every heart
With love

'Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
'Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
My mama's in the kitchen, worryin' about me
Seasons greetings, hope you're well
Well, I'm doing alright if you were wondering
Lately I can never tell
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine
I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And eveybody's here except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold
But for me it's just a lonely time
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
Merry Christmas everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
Were your cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
You were mine'],["It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas",'Andy Williams','It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten, it's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes that glow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
A pair of Hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that'll make 'em ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
Sure, it's Christmas once more'],['Tennessee Christmas','Alabama','Come on weather man give us a forecast snoowy white
Can't you hear the prayers of every childlike heart tonight
Rockies are callin', Denver snow fallin'
Somebody said it's four feet deep, but it doesn't matter
Give me the laughter, I'm gonna choose to keep
Another tender Tennessee Christmas, the only Chirstmas for me
Where the love circles arounf us like th gifts around our tree
Well I know there's more snow up in Colorado than my roof will ever see
But a tender Tennessee Christmas is the only Christmas for me
Every now and then I get a wanderin' urge to see
Maybe California, maybe Tinsel TOwn's for me
There's a parade there, we'd have it made there
Bring home a tan for New Year's Eve
Sure sounds exciting, awfully inviting, still I think I'm gonna keep
Another tender Tennessee Christmas, the only CHristmas for me
Where the love circles around us like the gifts around our tree
Well they say in L.A. it's a warm holiday, it's th only place to be
A tender Tennessee Christmas, is the only Christmas for me

I just had to meet you to make Christmas seem worthwhile
Last year when I had to send my Christmas cards
I had to sign my name alone
But now your name is next to mine
And there's more love in every line
I'm wishing a Merry Christmas to everyone I've known
No more blue Christmas' they'll all be bright
No more just pretending to be happy when I'm sad
Going through the motions while others feel glad
No more blue Christmas' now that I've found you
Oh, no wonder that I thought that they were going out of style
I just had to meet you to make Christmas seem worthwhile
Last year when I had to buy my Christmas gifts
I had to do it on my own
Ooh, champagne parties everywhere but without you I just didn't care
Now there's more than just a Christmas tree to decorate my home
No more blue Christmas' now that I've found you
Oh, no wonder that I thought that they were going out of style

A chill is in the air
And carols everywhere
Close your eyes, it's almost here
Candles and cards
And favorite movie scenes
The smell of evergreen
As special as it's always been
And I have a dream or two
Maybe they will come true
Setting our hopes on a big snow tonight
We'll wake up to a world of white
It's gonna be a christmas to remember
Light up the fire, play some Nat King Cole
Always sentimental and don't you know that
It's gonna be a Christmas to remember
I know it's true
Time doesn't stand still
Many things can change
But we know some things never will
The memories we share
The songs we always sing
The mystery of life
The hopefulness this season brings
And I have a dream or two
Maybe they will come true
Setting our hopes on a big snow tonight
We'll wake up to a world of white
It's gonna be a christmas to remember
Light up the fire, play some Nat King Cole

'Cause it is my favorite holiday.
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season.
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from last year.
Ski shop encounter most interesting.
Had his number but never the time,
Most of '81 passed along those lines.
So deck those halls. Trim those trees.
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer.
I just need to catch my breath;
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture. Frozen landscape,
Chill this room for twenty-four days.
Evergreens. Sparkling snow.
Get this winter over with!
Flash back to spring time saw him again
Would have been good to go for lunch.
Couldn't agree when we were both free.
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch.
Didn't of course 'till summer time,
Out to the beach to his boat.
Could I join him?'],['One Night A Year','Barbra Mandrell','Once again the windows shine with pretty lights
Once again our loved ones gather at our side
Busy crowds of strangers greet each other with a smile
There's Christmas in the eyes of every child
Once again the presents are resting by the tree
Once again we worship the One who came for you and me
I hear choirs of voices as they're singing out His name
Again we tell the story of how the Christ Child came
One night a year we believe in peace on earth
One night a year we praise our Savior's birth
I wish every night the whole year through could be
Like Christmas Eve
When love's pure light is shining everywhere, one night a year
Once again around the world heads are bowed in prayer
Once again the promise of peace is in the air
But soon will come the morning and the feeling will be past
And I can't help but wonder why the feeling only lasts
One night a year we believe in peace on earth
One night a year we praise our Savior's birth
I wish every night the whole year through could be
Like Christmas Eve
When love's pure light is shining everywhere, one night a year
One night a year we believe in peace on earth
One night a year we praise our Savior's birth
I wish every night the whole year through could be
Like Christmas Eve
When love's pure light is shining everywhere, one night a year

It's the season to be jolly
And be thankful for all that we have
All the lights and decorations

Of the joyful celebration

The happy, the sad

People smile as they are passing
Christmas time is here, our waiting is done
Wishing it could last forever
Not just twelve days in December

Through the year let's try to remember
That special way
That everyone feels
It's the magic of Christmas day

The good and the bad
The happy, the sad
Oh and God bless us everyone

Here's to family and friends
It's good to be here again

And through the eyes of girls and boys

Share their wonder, live through their joy
It's easy to do, just open your heart
The spirit will come to you

The happy, the sad
Oh and God bless us everyone
